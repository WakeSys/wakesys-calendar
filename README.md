## Installation

1. Include the required files in your HTML:

<!-- Required Dependencies -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js"></script>
<script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fullcalendar@6.1.10/index.global.min.js'></script>

<!-- WakeSys Calendar Files -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wakesys/wakesys-calendar@1.0.0/helpfunctions.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wakesys/wakesys-calendar@1.0.0/wakesyscalendar.js"></script>
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wakesys/wakesys-calendar@1.0.0/wakesyscalendar.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

2. Add the calendar container to your HTML:

```html
<div class='innerwrapper'>
    <div id='wakesys_calendar'></div>
</div>
```

## Event Colors and Visibility

The calendar supports automatic configuration of event colors and visibility settings. There are two ways to configure this:

1. **Automatic Generation**: Leave the configuration arrays empty, and the system will generate default settings on first use:

```javascript
var colors = {
};

var eventsToShow = {
};
```

On first load, this will trigger a popup showing suggested configurations that you can copy and customize.

2. **Manual Configuration**: Directly specify colors and visibility for each event type:

```javascript
var colors = {
    'Slot': '#88e645',   // Regular Opening Hours
    'Event1': '#ff0000', // Custom Event Type 1
    'Event2': '#00ff00'  // Custom Event Type 2
};

var eventsToShow = {
    'Slot': true,    // Show Regular Opening Hours
    'Event1': true,  // Show Custom Event Type 1
    'Event2': false  // Hide Custom Event Type 2
};
```

### Configuration Options:
- `colors`: Maps event types to their display colors (using hex color codes)
- `eventsToShow`: Controls visibility of each event type (true = show, false = hide)

To add new event types that you've created in WakeSys, simply leave the arrays empty and let the system generate updated configurations, then customize the colors and visibility as needed.
